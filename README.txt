This repo is meant to be a consolidated reference of common pandas operations, visualizations, and machine learning algorithms, to help some of my fellow data scientists. 

Most of the work/examples were consolidated through my coursework and Jose Portillaâ€™s Udemy Courses, listed below, which I would HIGHLY recommend.

Note - Notebook 05_cufflinks_tutorial_classic_Notebook_Only.ipynb will only work in a Jupyter Notebook classic (not Jupyter Lab).
